We model the structural requirements of Fork/Join with an abstraction for decomposition. In various drafts, this was called Splittable, Spliterator, or StreamAccessor, but the basic concept is that it is an extension of iteration that add the ability to ask the data structure to subdivide itself into recursively decomposible chunks. Just as an Iterator lets you carve off a single element and leave the rest in the Iterator, a Spliterator lets you carve off a chunk of the data, described by a new Spliterator (which can then be further decomposed) and leave the rest in the original Spliterator. Once a data structure provides a means of decomposition, the library can provide all the parallel stream operations. Decomposition for for common data structures like array-based lists, binary trees, and maps is straightforward.


```java
public interface Spliterator<T> {
    /** Carve off a portion of the data into a separate Spliterator */
    Spliterator<T> split();

    /** Iterate the data described by this Spliterator */
    Iterator<T> iterator();

    /** The size of the data described by this Spliterator, if known */
    int getSizeIfKnown();
}
```
